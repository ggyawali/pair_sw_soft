To use the soft core SW potential, use the following line in the initialization section of the input file

pair sw/soft mu n alpha solvent-type

mu is the variable that determines the solvation state. 0 = unsolvated state and 1 = fully solvated state

n is the exponent that appears in the formula for the soft core potential

alpha is another variable in the potential. We took alpha = 0.3

solvent-type is the atom type of the solvent. Counting of the atom types starts from 1. For ex if you are using

pair_coef ethane.sw mw CH3, solvent type is 1.
